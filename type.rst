Field Type
==========

Field Types are used for configuring a search field.

As you probably know, searching with the system works by defining searching conditions.
But in order to known how the value should be handled each field has a type specialized
in handling the value type/format.

The type is used for configuring the field so you don't have to apply all the configuration
for each field individually.

For a list of build-in types see :doc:`reference/types`.

Creating you're own field type is also possible.

See :doc:`cookbook/type/create_custom_field_type` for more information.
