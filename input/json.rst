JsonInput
=========

Processes input in the JSON format.

The required input structure is the same as :doc:`array`

The advantage of using the JsonInput processor instead decoding the JSON object
yourself is that the JsonInput processor does a linting on the provided input,
ensuring the JSON input is valid.
