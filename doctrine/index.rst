Doctrine
========

The Doctrine component facilitates the searching
of records using the Doctrine2 library.

Searching is possible with using Doctrine ORM (both DQL and NativeQuery).
Or other drivers provided by doctrine.

Support for ODM and other storage engines is planned for future releases.
If you`d like to contribute please read the contributing guidelines
in the README.md file.
