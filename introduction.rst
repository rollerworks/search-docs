Introduction
============

RollerworksSearch provides you with a powerful search system
for your PHP applications.

Search operations are performed using search conditions which allow
for any type of condition, all with minimum effort, whether you need
to search in one database table or multiple.

This system was designed to be useful for any storage back-end, user input
and locale.

Organization of this Book
-------------------------

This book has been written so that those who need information quickly are able
to find what they need, and those who wish to learn more advanced topics can
read deeper into each chapter.

The book begins with an overview of the Search system,
discussing what's included in the package and preparing you for the remainder
of the book.

It is possible to read this user guide just like any other book (from
beginning to end). Each chapter begins with a discussion of the contents it
contains, followed by a short code sample designed to give you a head start.
As you get further into a chapter you will learn more about component's
capabilities, but often you will be able to head directly to the topic you
wish to learn about.

Throughout this book you will be presented with code samples, which most
people should find ample to implement the Search system appropriately
in their own projects.

Code Samples
------------

Code samples presented in this book will be displayed on a different colored
background in a mono-spaced font. Samples are not to be taken as copy and paste
code snippets.

Code examples are used throughout the book to clarify what is written in text.
They will sometimes be usable as-is, but they should always be taken as
outline/pseudo code only.

A code sample will look like this:

.. code-block:: php

    class AClass
    {
        ...
    }

    // A Comment
    $obj = new AClass($arg1, $arg2, ... );

    /* A note about another way of doing something
    $obj = AClass::newInstance($arg1, $arg2, ... );
    */

The presence of 3 dots ``...`` in a code sample indicates that code has been excluded, for brevity.
They are not actually part of the code.

Multi-line comments are displayed as ``/* ... */`` and show alternative ways
of achieving the same result.

You should read the code examples given and try to understand them. They are
kept concise so that you are not overwhelmed with information.
