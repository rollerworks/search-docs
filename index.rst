Welcome to RollerworksSearch, RollerworksSearch is a powerful search-system
for PHP. Created to make searching in a PHP powered application as simple and
fast as possible.

In this manual you will find everything to get started and make the most
of the library. Start by :doc:`learning the basic terms <introduction>`,
then begin with :doc:`installing`, follow-up with :doc:`processing_searches`
and finally continue with integration extensions for your framework of choice.

Need more? The Cookbook provides you with some recipes to cook-up your
own field types, field type extensions, and framework integration.

If you need any help don't hesitate to get in touch at the
`RollerworksSearch Gitter Channel`_.
